## GDG Coimbatore DevFest 2022

`Coimbatore's Largest Developer Conference`

An annual event hosted by the Google Developers Group across the world to bring the technology closer to the developers. It is an all day developer conference where we aim to focus on multiple technologies through lightning talks, sessions, workshops, etc.

We at GDG Coimbatore are very excited to bring back the festival of developers to Coimbatore. We have a lot of exciting things planned for you this year including power packed sessions, and a lot of fun.
